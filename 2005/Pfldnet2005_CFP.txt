	Third International Workshop on Protocols for Fast Long-Distance Networks
				Pfldnet2005

 Fast long-distance networks (i.e., networks operating at 622 Mbit/s, 2.5 Gbit/s, or 10 
Gbit/s and spanning several countries or states) are now becoming commonplace. More and 
more researchers now routinely transfer between 10 GB and multi-TB datasets over gigabit 
networks. Application domains for such massive transfers include data-intensive Grids 
(e.g., in Particle Physics, Earth Observation, Bio informatics, and Radio Astronomy), 
database mirroring for Web sites (e.g., in e-commerce), and push-based Web cache updates.

 Although the network infrastructure is now in place, or will soon be, the transport and 
application protocols available to date perform rather poorly over such networks. Current 
versions of TCP, for instance, recover very slowly from packet loss when the RTT and the 
link capacity are large, thus requiring a large congestion window for high throughput. A 
number of research teams have begun investigating these protocol issues. 

 The First International Workshop on Protocols for Fast Long-Distance Networks 
(http://datatag.web.cern.ch/datatag/pfldnet2003/) and the Second International Workshop on 
Protocols for Fast Long-Distance Networks (http://www-didc.lbl.gov/PFLDnet2004/) were very 
successful in bringing together many researchers from the U.S., Asia and Europe who are 
working on these problems. This workshop will continue this tradition, and provide a perfect 
setting for researchers in this area to exchange ideas and experience.

 This single-track workshop will provide researchers and technologists with a focused, highly 
interactive opportunity to present, discuss and exchange experience on leading research, 
development and future directions in high performance transport and application protocols 
(TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP, etc.) over fast long-distance networks. 

 This year, a particular emphasis will be on End Systems Issues (hardware and software). Each 
day will start with a plenary talk and end with a panel. In between, formal presentations of 
papers will be followed by extensive and informal Q&A sessions. Authors are invited to submit 
unpublished extended abstract for consideration.

 In order to facilitate discussions, attendance will be limited to 60 participants. Please 
register early to ensure your participation. Depending on the number of people who register, 
we may need to restrict the number of people from a given organization to allow for a broader 
representation of the research community. Registration will open on October 1, 2004. 

 Call For Papers
 ---------------

   Participants wishing to present a paper should upload a four-pages extended 
 abstract to http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/RESO/pfldnet2005/Soumission by October 15 (2004). 
 Authors whose abstracts are selected for presentation 
will have the option to submit a full paper, to be published on the PFLDnet 2005 web site and in 
the PFLDnet 2005 proceedings. We may try to collect the best papers for a special edition of a 
journal, if the authors are interested.

 Scope 
 -----

  The Pfldnet2005 workshop will focus on research issues and challenges as well as lessons learned 
 from experience. Topics of interest include and are not limited to:

    Protocol issues in fast long-distance networks 

    TCP enhancements and their comparison

    Novel data transport protocols designed for new application services

    RDMA over WANs

    Effects of shaping on TCP and UDP traffic 

    Effects of striping and multistreaming 

    Bulk-data transfer applications both TCP and non-TCP based

    Data replication and multicasting strategies and protocols

    Simulation-based results

    Experiments on real networks and actual measurements 

    Experience with different types of hardware (PCs, routers, switches, Gigabit Ethernet cards, etc.)
