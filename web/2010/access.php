	 <H2> General Instructions: </H2>
	 General instructions on getting to the venue are listed 
	 <a href="http://www.fandm.edu/get-here">here</a>.  
	 The closest airport is Harrisburg International Airport (HIA),
	 at a ~1 hour drive from the venue.
	 Harrisburg is a small airport, however,
	 and you are likely to have more options flying into 
	 Philadelphia International Airport (PHL).
	 (particularly for those planning to attend CoNEXT in Philadelphia.)
	 Note that PHL is not mentioned in the page linked to above;
	 more detailed information on getting to the venue from 
     HIA and PHL follows.
